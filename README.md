To classify sushi and sandwich images, various image classification models of Tensorflow and Keras are used. Multiple networks with various models that have been used are described below: 
1.	VGG16 model with multiple combination of networks. 
2.	ResNet50 model with multiple combination of networks. 
3.	VGG19 model with multiple combination of networks. 
4.	InceptionV3 model with one combination of networks
5.	MobileNetV2 model with one combination of networks
