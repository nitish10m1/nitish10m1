Problem Statements: 
Imagine that you are a Recipe Author at Cookpad. For an upcoming event you feel motivated to create a dish that is novel and is inspired by your love of world food. After much deliberation you are struck by the simple idea of combining your two favorite light snacks, Sushi and Sandwiches. You are convinced that this dish is unique and decide to call it “Sushidi”. However, to conduct some due diligence you decide to check the Cookpad platform for examples of Sushidi, just to be sure. Based on the provided dataset please develop an automated method or workflow to analyse the contents and output a list of filenames that could potentially be considered as “Sushidi”. Your approach can use any area of machine or deep learning in order to accomplish that task.
